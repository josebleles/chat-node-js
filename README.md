#chat-node-js
This is just a simple study using nodejs server with expres and web api being consumed by ajax jquery, i'ved focus on back-end.

node-server/main.js is a chat using prompt to talk with another person that is running node-server/main.js too.

node-server/tudo.js is a web api that response the ajax of my web/index.html, is such more easy to use with more than one person because don't have to edit nothing.
